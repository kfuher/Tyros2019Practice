AUTONOMOUS LOGIC
	
	0) use prox sensor to always detect if a robot is within a few feet
	0) manual override (at every individual command, we will use a button press to stop the program and start teleop)

	ROCKET AUTON

		START HATCH BALL LOADED [START AT SIDE OF PLATFORM] <HORIZONTAL VALUES ARE REVERSED FOR THE OTHER ROCKET> 			(BOTTOM 2 HATCHES AND THEN 2 BALLS)
		1) drive straight off the side of the level 1 platform

		3) use color sensors to follow white line
	-----------------
		4) prox sensor to stop right in front of rocket
		5) drop HATCH in a spot
		6) back up, following white line along line
		7) keep following until white line is no longer visible
		8) rotate 90 deg toward the alliance station
		9) drive forward and use prox sensor to stop before wall (have the robot remember how much distance this was)
		10) use human player to load HATCH
		11) rotate 180 deg
		12) drive the same distance and strafe slightly and align with hatch line (alternate sides)
		13) align and deploy HATCH

		29) align and deploy BALL
		30) back up, following white line along line
		31) keep following until white line is no longer visible
		32) rotate ~60 deg toward the alliance station
		33) drive forward and use prox sensor to stop before wall (have the robot remember how much distance this was)
		34) use human player to load HATCH
		35) rotate 180 deg
		36) drive the same distance and strafe slightly and align with ball line (middle)
