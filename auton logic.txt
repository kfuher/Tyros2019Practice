AUTOMATION LOGIC
	
	y) use prox sensor to always detect if a robot is within a few feet
	z) manual override

	ROCKET AUTON [1 BALL AND THEN 1 HATCH: 50/50 CHANCE THEY ARE THE SAME SIDE]

		START WITH BALL LOADED
		a) drive straight off the side of the level 1 platform
		b) strafe diagonally to the ball deposit (middle) of the rocket
		c) switch to ROCKET LOOP

	ROCKET LOOP [START AT WHITE LINE]

		d) use color sensors to follow white line
		e) prox sensor to stop right in front of rocket
		f) drop BALL in a spot
		g) back up, following white line along line
		h) keep following until white line is no longer visible
		i) rotate 90 deg toward the alliance station
		j) drive forward and use prox sensor to stop before wall (have the robot remember how much distance this was)
		k) use human player to load HATCH
		l) rotate 180 deg
		m) drive the same distance and strafe slightly and align with hatch line (alternate sides)
		n) align and deploy HATCH
		o) back up, following white line along line
		p) keep following until white line is no longer visible
		q) rotate ~60 deg toward the alliance station
		r) drive forward and use prox sensor to stop before wall (have the robot remember how much distance this was)
		s) use human player to load BALL
		t) rotate 180 deg
		u) drive the same distance and strafe slightly and align with ball line (middle)

	CARGO AUTON [1 BALL AND 1 HATCH IN EITHER ORDER, FOR THE SAME SPOT]

		START WITH BALL/HATCH LOADED
		a) drive straight off side of level 1 platform
		b) switch to CARGO LOOP

	CARGO LOOP [START AT WHITE LINE]
		
		c) use color sensors to follow white line
		d) prox sensor to stop right in front of cargo ship
		e) drop BALL/HATCH in a spot
		f) back up, following white line along line
		g) rotate 180 deg
		h) strafe to the side
		i) drive forward and use prox sensor to stop before wall (have the robot remember how much distance this was)
		j) use human player to load HATCH/BALL
		k) rotate 180 deg
		l) drive the same distance back
		m) strafe the opposite velocity
		n) use color sensors to follow white line
		o) prox sensor to stop right in front of cargo ship
		p) drop HATCH/BALL in a spot
