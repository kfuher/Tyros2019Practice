AUTOMATION LOGIC
	
	y) use prox sensor to always detect if a robot is within a few feet
	z) manual override

	ROCKET AUTON

		START HATCH BALL LOADED
		1) drive straight off the side of the level 1 platform
		2) strafe diagonally to the ball deposit (middle) of the rocket
		3) switch to ROCKET LOOP

	ROCKET LOOP [START AT WHITE LINE]

		4) use color sensors to follow white line
		5) prox sensor to stop right in front of rocket
		6) drop HATCH in a spot
		7) back up, following white line along line
		8) keep following until white line is no longer visible
		9) rotate 90 deg toward the alliance station
		10) drive forward and use prox sensor to stop before wall (have the robot remember how much distance this was)
		11) use human player to load HATCH
		12) rotate 180 deg
		13) drive the same distance and strafe slightly and align with hatch line (alternate sides)
		14) align and deploy HATCH
		15) back up, following white line along line
		16) keep following until white line is no longer visible
		17) rotate 90 deg toward the alliance station
		18) drive forward and use prox sensor to stop before wall (have the robot remember how much distance this was)
		19) use human player to load BALL
		20) rotate 180 deg
		21) drive the same distance and strafe slightly and align with hatch line (alternate sides)
		22) align and deploy BALL
		23) back up, following white line along line
		24) keep following until white line is no longer visible
		25) rotate 90 deg toward the alliance station
		26) drive forward and use prox sensor to stop before wall (have the robot remember how much distance this was)
		27) use human player to load BALL
		28) rotate 180 deg
		29) drive the same distance and strafe slightly and align with hatch line (alternate sides)
		30) align and deploy BALL
		31) back up, following white line along line
		32) keep following until white line is no longer visible
		33) rotate ~60 deg toward the alliance station
		34) drive forward and use prox sensor to stop before wall (have the robot remember how much distance this was)
		35) use human player to load HATCH
		36) rotate 180 deg
		37) drive the same distance and strafe slightly and align with ball line (middle)

	CARGO AUTON [1 BALL AND 1 HATCH IN EITHER ORDER, FOR THE SAME SPOT]

		START WITH HATCH/BALL LOADED
		1) drive straight off side of level 1 platform
		2) switch to CARGO LOOP

	CARGO LOOP [START AT WHITE LINE]
		
		3) use color sensors to follow white line
		4) prox sensor to stop right in front of cargo ship
		5) drop HATCH/BALL in a spot
		6) back up, following white line along line
		7) rotate 180 deg
		8) strafe to the side
		9) drive forward and use prox sensor to stop before wall (have the robot remember how much distance this was)
		10) use human player to load BALL/HATCH
		11) rotate 180 deg
		12) drive the same distance back
		13) strafe the opposite velocity
		14) use color sensors to follow white line
		15) prox sensor to stop right in front of cargo ship
		16) drop HATCH/BALL in a spot
